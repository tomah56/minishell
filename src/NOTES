ToDo:

- Signal D
- Signals in Heredoc
- in this case for example: echo 1 | > test.txt   - we delete the second command and that will result in taht we print the 1 to the screen
but bash is not behaving like this. we have to save the information that we had another command and execute properly
- exit status is not handeled everywhere correctly
- $? is not handeled
- leaks
