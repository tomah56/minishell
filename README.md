# minishell
## Short description of the project
One of the very famous 42 curriculum projects. Code name was "miniHELL"
The goal of the subject was to recreate some of the functionalities of bash (Version 3.2).<br>
The guideline was "check bash" So it gave us an infinite possibility for bug hunting. Edge cases after edge cases. Our project canvas was looking like a Christmas tree. But we made it through. After some segf! we had it running. Our own personal and beautiful command line tool!

## From the subject pdf
### Introduction

irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with
a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close
to english.
With Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems
people faced when Windows didn’t exist.
